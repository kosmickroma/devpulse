# DevPulse Roadmap

This document outlines the vision and development roadmap for DevPulse.

## Vision

**DevPulse aims to be the #1 platform for developers to discover trending tech content across the entire developer ecosystem.**

From trending GitHub repos to popular discussions, breaking tech news to emerging toolsâ€”all aggregated, filtered, and personalized in one beautiful interface.

## Product Phases

### Phase 1: CLI Foundation âœ… (v1.0 - Current)

**Goal:** Prove the concept with working scrapers and clean architecture

**Status:** COMPLETE
- âœ… Scrapy-based scraping framework
- âœ… Pydantic data validation
- âœ… Modular pipeline architecture
- âœ… Hacker News spider (working)
- âœ… Dev.to spider (working)
- âœ… CLI interface
- âœ… CSV export
- âœ… Professional documentation

**Deliverable:** Functional CLI tool that developers can use today

### Phase 2: GitHub Integration (v1.1 - âœ… COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Add GitHub trending via official API

**Why API over scraping?**
- Reliable (no HTML changes breaking it)

- Better data (more fields available)
- Production-ready
- Rate limits but generous for free tier

**Tasks:**
- [x] Research GitHub API authentication
- [x] Implement GitHub API client
- [x] Create new `github_api_spider.py`
- [x] Add rate limit handling
- [x] Support language filtering
- [x] Support time range (daily/weekly/monthly)
- [x] Update CLI to use new spider
- [x] Test with free tier limits
- [x] Documentation

**Deliverable:** âœ… DevPulse with 3 fully working platforms (DELIVERED: 2025-10-30)

## Architecture Principles

**For Scaling:**

1. **Modular Design**
   - Each platform = separate spider/module
   - Easy to add/remove platforms
   - Independent deployment possible

2. **Data Layer**
   - Unified schema across platforms
   - Easy to query cross-platform
   - Historical tracking built-in

3. **API-First**
   - CLI, Web UI, Mobile all use same API
   - Easy to build new interfaces
   - Third-party integrations possible

4. **Performance**
   - Caching at multiple layers
   - Efficient scraping schedules
   - Background jobs for heavy processing

## Success Metrics

**v1.0-1.1 (Current):**
- âœ… Code quality and architecture
- âœ… Working scrapers (all 3 platforms live)
- âœ… v1.1 Complete: GitHub API integration
- [ ] 10+ GitHub stars
- [ ] 5+ users trying it

**v2.0 (Web UI):**
- [ ] 100+ active users
- [ ] 100+ GitHub stars
- [ ] Positive feedback on design
- [ ] <2s page load time

**v3.0 (SaaS):**
- [ ] 1,000+ active users

- **v2.0:** 2-3 months (Web UI)
- **v2.x:** 3-6 months (More platforms)
- **v3.0:** 6-12 months (SaaS features)
- **v4.0:** 12-18 months (Scale & monetize)

*Timelines flexible based on traction and feedback*

## Open Questions

1. **Pricing strategy:** How much would devs pay for this?
2. **Monetization timing:** When to introduce paid tiers?
3. **Competition:** How do we differentiate from similar tools?
4. **Platform priority:** Which platforms give most value?
5. **Mobile app:** Native app or PWA?
