# DevPulse Roadmap

This document outlines the vision and development roadmap for DevPulse.

## Vision

**DevPulse aims to be the #1 platform for developers to discover trending tech content across the entire developer ecosystem.**

From trending GitHub repos to popular discussions, breaking tech news to emerging tools—all aggregated, filtered, and personalized in one beautiful interface.

## Product Phases

### Phase 1: CLI Foundation ✅ (v1.0 - Current)

**Goal:** Prove the concept with working scrapers and clean architecture

**Status:** COMPLETE

- ✅ CSV export
- ✅ Professional documentation

**Deliverable:** Functional CLI tool that developers can use today

---

### Phase 2: GitHub Integration (v1.1 - ✅ COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Add GitHub trending via official API

**Why API over scraping?**

## Architecture Principles

**For Scaling:**

1. **Modular Design**
   - Each platform = separate spider/module
   - Easy to add/remove platforms
   - Independent deployment possible

2. **Data Layer**
   - Unified schema across platforms
   - Easy to query cross-platform
   - Historical tracking built-in

3. **API-First**
   - CLI, Web UI, Mobile all use same API
   - Easy to build new interfaces
   - Third-party integrations possible

4. **Performance**
   - Caching at multiple layers
   - Efficient scraping schedules
   - Background jobs for heavy processing

## Success Metrics

**v1.0-1.1 (Current):**
- ✅ Code quality and architecture
- ✅ Working scrapers (all 3 platforms live)

## Open Questions

1. **Pricing strategy:** How much would devs pay for this?
2. **Monetization timing:** When to introduce paid tiers?
3. **Competition:** How do we differentiate from similar tools?
4. **Platform priority:** Which platforms give most value?
5. **Mobile app:** Native app or PWA?
