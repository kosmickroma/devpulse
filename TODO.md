# DevPulse - Task List

## ✅ v2.0 MVP Complete! (2025-10-30)

**The interactive web dashboard is LIVE!** 🎉

- ✅ Frontend: https://devpulse-1z8l.vercel.app
- ✅ Backend: https://devpulse-api.onrender.com
- ✅ All 3 platforms scanning successfully (GitHub, Hacker News, Dev.to)
- ✅ Real-time SSE streaming working
- ✅ Cards displaying trending content
- ✅ Auto-scan on page load
- ✅ Authentic Fallout 3 terminal sounds (MIT licensed)
- ✅ GitHub Actions keep-alive preventing backend sleep

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Sound Effects During Auto-Scan
- **Issue:** Sounds play when typing commands, but NOT during the automatic scan on page load
- **Root Cause:** Browser autoplay restrictions prevent audio before user interaction
- **Current Status:** Attempted audio unlock pattern, but needs further work
- **Potential Solutions:**
  1. Require one click/keypress before enabling sounds
  2. Play silent audio on first interaction
  3. Use Web Audio API oscillator (less authentic feel)
  4. Accept limitation and only play sounds on manual scans
- **Priority:** Low (UX enhancement, not breaking)

## 🎯 Next Priorities (v2.1)

### High Priority
1. **Fix auto-scan sounds** - Resolve browser autoplay restrictions
   - Try alternative unlock patterns
   - Consider user interaction requirement
   - Test across different browsers

2. **Platform filter tabs** - Allow filtering by source
   - Add tabs for All, GitHub, Hacker News, Dev.to
   - Update FilterBar component
   - Sync with existing source filtering

3. **Error handling improvements**
   - Better cold-start messaging (Render free tier sleeps)
   - Retry logic for failed scans
   - User-friendly error messages

### Medium Priority
4. **Additional commands**
   - `filter [source]` - Filter by platform
   - `search [term]` - Search within results
   - `theme [name]` - Change color scheme

5. **Visual enhancements**
   - ASCII progress bars during scanning
   - Animated loading states
   - Smoother transitions

6. **Performance**
   - Optimize SSE connection handling
   - Add data caching
   - Reduce initial load time

### Low Priority
7. **Documentation**
   - Add screenshots to README
   - Video demo
   - API documentation
