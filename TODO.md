# DevPulse TODO

## ✅ Completed (Today's Session)
- [x] Auto-demo mode polish (text changes, timing, audio)
- [x] SYNTH personality matching production
- [x] Optional sound indicator for office-friendly demos
- [x] Zero-lag timing restoration

## 🚀 Next Priorities

### Demo Mode
- [ ] Add progress counter during cached burst (147/168 items...)
- [ ] Flash/glow cards section after SYNTH results
- [ ] Mobile-specific demo (shorter/different flow)
- [ ] Analytics tracking (demo_started, demo_completed, etc.)

### SYNTH Improvements
- [ ] Apply smart search to Reddit/HN/Dev.to (currently only GitHub)
- [ ] Conversation history persistence

### Performance
- [ ] Parallel terminal scans (10-15s → 3-5s potential)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness polish

### Features
- [ ] Widget-based dashboard (per ROADMAP.md)
- [ ] Jobs board integration improvements

## 📝 Notes
- Demo is production-ready, test on Vercel before next session
- Sound indicator works great for office scenarios
- All timing issues resolved
